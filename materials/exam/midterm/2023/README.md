同2樓說的 parent用fork()生出來的child會從fork()繼
續往下做，所以i=0時，執行 fork()==0，這裏fork生下而fork()則分別return parent他的child的pid(不為0)
續往下做，所以i=0時，執行 fork()==0，這裏fork生下 01/25 12:31
生下第一個child 而fork()則分別return parent他的 01/25 12:31
child的pid(不為0) 同時return給child 0,所以child會 01/25 12:32
進入{fork();fork();fork()}。第一次fork時生下一個 01/25 12:34
一個child(1+1-->1+2); 第二個fork()時, 後面兩個 01/25 12:36
child各生下一個，所以現在(1+2-->1+4);第三次fork() 01/25 12:36
時，後面四個都再生一個，所以(1+4-->1+8)，執行完 01/25 12:37
i=0後，共有9個process。同理, i=1時，這9個分別再生 01/25 12:37
出9*8=72個，i=1結束共有9+9*8=81個; i=2時生下81*8 01/25 12:38
=648個。i=2結束，共有81+648=729個。程式結束。
